#Javascript Weekly Challenge #1

*Starting today, I plan on coming out with a new JavaScript challenge every week. These problems might look leisurely and pointless at the outset, but solving them should require intermediate-level language skills. Answers will be posted at the end of the week, one day before the next challenge comes out. Cheers!*

> How would you make the following work? <br />
`add(2, 5); // returns 7` <br />
`add(2)(5); // returns 7` <br />
`add(2)(5)(1, 3)(4); // returns 15` <br />
`add(2)(5)(1, 3)(4)(1, 1, 2)(1)()(1, 1); // returns 22` <br />

**DISCLAIMER** I came across this problem while going through the very popular [Front-end Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) repo on Github. It caught my attention since I'd recently seen something similar in Angus Croll's [*If Hemingway Wrote Javascript*](http://www.amazon.com/Hemingway-Wrote-JavaScript-Angus-Croll/dp/1593275854).
